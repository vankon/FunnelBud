          <div class="section-text">
            According to Gartner, customers use digital channels at all stages of their buying journey. To
            meet them there, you need to market towards situations that your customers find themselves in
            instead of Personas. Here, we show you how!

          <div class="about-wrapper__content">
            <p>Over 87% of our customers gather information on
              digital channels before, during and after a purchase.</p>
            <p>This means that it is no longer we who are driving a
              sales process towards the customer - but the
              customer who is driving a buying process towards us.</p>
            <p>We must meet the customer on their turf: Online.</p>
            <p>To do this, we need to revise the way we segment our
              customers. Our customers are not attributes such as
              their industry, role or persona. They are individuals
              who find themselves in situations we can help them
              solve.</p>
            <p>To succeed, we need to create buying journeys that
              target the situations our customers find themselves
              in.</p>

            <p>Start with an insight targeting the situation your
              customers may find themselves in. Offer your
              insight in for example a guide behind a form.
              Produce articles and other content about the
              situation and the insight, and spread this content
              via social media and paid ads.</p>
            <p>Continue nurturing contacts who download your
              guide with educational and relevant content, and
              get in touch when your customer is interested in
              talking.</p>
